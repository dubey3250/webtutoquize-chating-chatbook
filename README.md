This project was developed using the languages PHP,HTML,CSS,javascripts for the purpose of playing a quiz test in the given 
time interval and it also tutorials to the user basically the website was fully dynamic it means that if the admin wants to change anything
 of the website , they can change. and apart from that i had provided an additional feature to the project with a seperate module which provides
 a platform to the user to chat them and also can comment to the user'd pictures if they have uploaded ,search etc.
